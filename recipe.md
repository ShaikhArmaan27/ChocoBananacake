Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place rack in the center of the oven. Butter, or spray with a non stick vegetable spray, a 9 x 13 inch (23 x 33 cm) pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.

In another large bowl, whisk the eggs. Then stir in the mashed bananas, water (or coffee), milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir, or whisk, until combined. (The batter is quite thin.) Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 35 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  

Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. When completely cooled, frost with the Ganache.

Ganache: Place the chopped chocolate in a medium sized stainless steel, or heatproof bowl. Set aside. Heat the cream and butter in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat (can also be heated in the microwave). Bring just to a boil. Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for a few minutes. Stir until smooth, then let stand at room temperature until the Ganache has completely cooled (can also place in the refrigerator). Then with a hand mixer or wire whisk beat until soft and fluffy. Spread the Ganache on the top of the cake.

And your Cake is ready
